1. [Exact solution of the Initial Value Problem.](https://github.com/BullDog57Rus/Differential-Equations/blob/master/Analytic/Exact%20analytic%20solution.pdf)
2. []()
3. [Structure of the program.](https://github.com/BullDog57Rus/Differential-Equations/blob/master/Analytic/Structure%20of%20the%20program.pdf)
4. [Description of each method.](https://github.com/BullDog57Rus/Differential-Equations/blob/master/Analytic/Explanations%20of%20methods.pdf)
5. [The graph of the methods.](https://github.com/BullDog57Rus/Differential-Equations/blob/master/Pictures/Numerical%20methods.svg) There is the .svg file where it is not so easy to find out the difference between some plots (because they overlap), but if you run the [code](https://github.com/BullDog57Rus/Differential-Equations/blob/master/Code/Calc%20and%20plot.ipynb), you can scroll the plot and see the difference.
6. [The graph of the global errors.](https://github.com/BullDog57Rus/Differential-Equations/blob/master/Pictures/Errors%20for%20methods.svg) It is not the error function of grid size, but inversely the error function of step size. So as step size become bigger, bigger become the error.
